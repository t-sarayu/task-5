📂 Files Included
Titanic dataset (from Kaggle)

task 5.ipynb: Jupyter Notebook with analysis and plots

eda_report.pdf: Summary of findings with visual insights

README.md: Project overview

📊 Analysis Performed
Data inspection using .info(), .describe(), .value_counts()

Handling missing data

Visualizations using Seaborn:

Pairplot (with hue='Survived')

Correlation heatmap

Histogram of Age

Boxplot of Fare vs Survival

Scatterplot of Age vs Fare

Observations recorded for each visual

🧠 Key Insights
Higher survival for 1st class passengers and those who paid higher fares

Women and children had better survival odds

Pclass, Fare, and Sex are important survival predictors
